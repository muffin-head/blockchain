# Decentralized Payment Application

## Overview
This project develops a decentralized payment system using Solidity for smart contracts and Java for application logic. It aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent payment environment.

## Features
- **Smart Contracts**: Implemented using Solidity to manage transactions and enforce contract terms automatically.
- **Backend Implementation**: Java is used to handle the application logic and integrate with the Ethereum blockchain for testing.
- **Real-world Testing**: Deployed on the Ethereum testnet to simulate actual user interactions.
- **Java Applets**: Enhance user interface and interaction through lightweight Java applets.

## Technologies Used
- Solidity
- Java
- Ethereum Blockchain

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/decentralized-payment-app.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```
   cd decentralized-payment-app
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   - For Java:
     ```
     Install Java and configure your environment accordingly.
